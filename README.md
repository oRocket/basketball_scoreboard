# Basketball Scoreboard
## Overview
This project is a simple and interactive basketball scoreboard web application that allows users to keep track of the scores for two teams: Home and Away. The application displays the current scores, allows users to increment the scores by 1, 2, or 3 points, and dynamically shows which team is leading or if the game is a draw.

## Features
 - **Score Tracking**: Users can update the scores for both Home and Away teams.
 - **Dynamic Score Display**: The application updates the scoreboard in real-time as scores are added.
 - **Leading Indicator**: Displays which team is currently leading and by how many points, or if the game is a draw.
 - **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes, ensuring usability on mobile devices.

## Project Structure
 - **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the webpage and includes references to the CSS and JavaScript files.
 - **index.css**: Contains all the styles for the scoreboard, including layout, colors, and typography.
 - **index.js**: Handles the logic for updating the scores and determining which team is leading.

## How to Use
 1. Open index.html in your web browser.
 2. Click the buttons under the Home and Away sections to add 1, 2, or 3 points to the respective team's score.
 3. Watch as the scoreboard updates in real-time and the leading team or draw status is displayed below the scoreboard.

## Customization
 - Fonts: The project uses the "Cursed Timer ULiL" font for the scoreboard, which can be changed by updating the link in the <head> section of index.html.
 - Colors: The colors used for the background, buttons, and text are defined in index.css and can be customized to fit different themes.
